Changing administrative regional boundaries over time complicates the construction of consistent regional panel data. The `nuts` package can transform **European regional data** identified by **NUTS codes** between different **versions** and **subdivision levels** with the aim to harmonize and link data sets. 

The package's main task is to convert data between all NUTS versions in use: 2006, 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2021. These conversions can be performed in any direction based on **spatial interpolation** using five different weights (regional area in square kilometers, 2011 and 2018 population size, 2012 and 2018 built-up area). The weights are based on conversion tables provided by the [Joint Research Center (JRC) of the European Commission (EC)](<https://urban.jrc.ec.europa.eu/nutsconverter/#/>) that are used in their online converter. The `nuts` package permits to do the same conversion offline with additional advantages such as the conversion within groups, enabling the conversion of datasets with multiple NUTS versions efficiently.

### Installation
